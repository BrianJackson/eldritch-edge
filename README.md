## Eldritch Edge - Custom Melee Subclasses for Warlock in Baldur's Gate 3
Eldritch Edge is a mod that aims to add custom melee oriented subclasses to the Warlock class in Baldur's Gate 3.  These "homebrew" subclasses inspired by creations on the 5e Homebrew - D&D Wiki, lore from The Forgotten Realms Wiki and my own ideas. 

This mod is available at the Balur's Gate 3 Nexus here https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/101
